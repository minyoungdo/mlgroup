Machine Learning Final Project

2. Group Presentation (20%): During the final week (two class periods) at the end of the quarter, teams will present their final projects to the class. Though I do not have a specific set of guidelines for what your presentation should include, good presentations typically include some combination of the following:
• Introduce the topic to a general audience with a motivating anecdote, paradox, or example
• Summarize your process, workflow, and your main approach or method
• Highlight the key findings
• “Appendix” set of slides with more detail at the end in case you are questioned on specific “in-the-weeds”-type details
The presentation should be around 8-10 minutes long, plus 5 minutes for questions. All members of the group should participate in the presentation. Presentation order will be determined at random and announced later in the quarter.
I like to give presentation awards to both encourage greater quality, and also democratize class participation. Two awards will be given for presentations:
• Best Oral Presentation • Most Creative Project
The awards will be determined by class voting, where each student will fill out a card in
class (I will provide the cards), voting for each presentation on a scale from 1-10 for each
of the 2 categories, where 10 is best. I will collect the cards at the end of the second
day of presentations. Upon summing the points across each award category, the highest
point-getter wins the respective award. Only 1 winner is allowed for each category, and
the winner gets a 5% bonus (half a letter-grade) on the final project report, which can be > 100%.


Final Report (35%):
The final project report is the distillation of your group’s efforts over the course of the quarter. Only one report should be submitted by your group, with each person’s name on the report. It should be around 12-15 pages double spaced, excluding references (but you can have an Appendix of any length you like). Note that all code should be placed in the Appendix, different than the problem sets. Code must be submitted for reproducibility.
The final report should contain some combination (if not all) of the following sections:
• Title Page & Contribution Statement (listing all group members and their roles in the project; note that by including your name on the project, you agree that you contributed equally to the project)
• Introduction, motivation, & (light) literature review
• Empirical strategy (methods, data, preprocessing, etc.)
• Analysis & results
• Discussion
• Conclusion
